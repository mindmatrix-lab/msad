index_copy_:
    description: |
        index_copy_(dim, index, tensor) -> Tensor

        Copies the elements of `tensor` into the `self` by selecting the indices in the order given in `index` .

        .. note::
            The value of `index` must be in the range `[0, self.shape[dim])` , if it is out of range, the result is undefined.

            If value of `index` contains duplicate entries, the result is nondeterministic since it depends on the last copy operation that occurred.

        Args:
            dim (int): The dimension along which to `index` .
            index (Tensor): A 1-D Tensor with the indices to access in `self` along the specified `dim` .
            tensor (Tensor): The tensor containing values to copy.

        Returns:
            Return `self` Tensor.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``

        Examples:
            >>> import mindspore
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor, mint
            >>> x = mint.ones((5, 3), dtype=mindspore.int64)
            >>> index = Tensor([4, 0, 2])
            >>> tensor = Tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], dtype=mindspore.int64)
            >>> x.index_copy_(0, index, tensor)
            Tensor(shape=[5, 3], dtype=Int64, value=
            [[4 5 6]
             [1 1 1]
             [7 8 9]
             [1 1 1]
             [1 2 3]])
