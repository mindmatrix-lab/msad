        clone() -> Tensor

        Returns a copy of self.

        Note:
            This function is differentiable, and gradients will flow back directly from the calculation
            result of the function to the `self`.

        Returns:
            Tensor, with the same data, shape and type as `self`.

        Supported Platforms:
            ``Ascend``

        Examples:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from mindspore import Tensor
            >>> input = Tensor(np.ones((3,3)).astype("float32"))
            >>> output = input.clone()
            >>> print(output)
            [[1. 1. 1.]
             [1. 1. 1.]
             [1. 1. 1.]]
