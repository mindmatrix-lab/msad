index_fill_:
  description: |
    index_fill_(dim, index, value) -> Tensor

    Fills the elements under the `dim` dimension of the `self` Tensor with the input `value`
    by selecting the indices in the order given in `index`.

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    .. note::
        While calculating the gradient of `value` , the value of `index` must be in the range `[0, self.shape[dim])` ,
        if it is out of range, the result is undefined.

    Args:
        dim (int): Dimension along which to fill the `self` Tensor.
        index (Tensor): Indices of the `self` Tensor to fill in. The `index` must be a 0D or 1D Tensor with dtype int32
            or int64.
        value (Union[Tensor, Number, bool]): Value to fill the `self` Tensor. The `value` is a number or a bool or a
            tensor whose data type is number or bool. If `value` is a Tensor, it must be a 0D Tensor.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the shape and the data type are the same as those of `self` .

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the data type of `index` is not int32 or int64.
        RuntimeError: If `dim` is out of range :math:`[-self.ndim, self.ndim)`.
        RuntimeError: If the rank of `index` is greater than 1.
        RuntimeError: If `value` is a Tensor and its rank is not equal to 0.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> x = Tensor(np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> dim = 1
        >>> index = Tensor(np.array([0, 2]), mindspore.int32)
        >>> value = Tensor(0, mindspore.int32)
        >>> output = x.index_fill_(dim, index, value)
        >>> print(output)
        [[ 0  2  0]
         [ 0  5  0]]
        >>> print(x)
        [[ 0  2  0]
         [ 0  5  0]]
