        conv1d(input, weight, bias=None, stride=1, padding=0, dilation=1, groups=1) -> Tensor

        Applies a 1D convolution over an input tensor. The input tenor is typically
        of shape :math:`(N, C_{in}, L_{in})`,
        where :math:`N` is batch size, :math:`C` is channel number, :math:`L` is sequence length.

        The output is calculated based on formula:

        .. math::

            \text{out}(N_i, C_{\text{out}_j}) = \text{bias}(C_{\text{out}_j}) +
            \sum_{k = 0}^{C_{in} - 1} \text{ccor}({\text{weight}(C_{\text{out}_j}, k), \text{X}(N_i, k)})

        where :math:`bias` is the output channel bias, :math:`ccor` is
        the `cross-correlation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation>`_,
        :math:`weight` is the convolution kernel value and :math:`X` represents the input feature map.

        - :math:`i` corresponds to the batch number, the range is :math:`[0, N-1]`,
          where :math:`N` is the batch size of the input.

        - :math:`j` corresponds to the output channel, the range is :math:`[0, C_{out}-1]`,
          where :math:`C_{out}` is the number of
          output channels, which is also equal to the number of kernels.

        - :math:`k` corresponds to the input channel, the range is :math:`[0, C_{in}-1]`,
          where :math:`C_{in}` is the number of
          input channels, which is also equal to the number of channels in the convolutional kernels.

        Therefore, in the above formula, :math:`{bias}(C_{\text{out}_j})` represents the bias of the :math:`j`-th
        output channel, :math:`{weight}(C_{\text{out}_j}, k)` represents the slice of the :math:`j`-th convolutional
        kernel in the :math:`k`-th channel, and :math:`{X}(N_i, k)` represents the slice of the :math:`k`-th input
        channel in the :math:`i`-th batch of the input feature map.

        The shape of the convolutional kernel is given by :math:`(\text{kernel_size})`,
        where :math:`\text{kernel_size}` is the length of the kernel.
        If we consider the input and output channels as well as the `groups` parameter, the complete kernel shape
        will be :math:`(C_{out}, C_{in} / \text{groups}, \text{kernel_size})`,
        where `groups` is the number of groups dividing `x`'s input channel when applying groups convolution.

        <http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf>`_.

        Args:
            input (Tensor): Tensor of shape :math:`(N, C_{in}, L_{in})` or :math:`(C_{in}, L_{in})`.
            weight (Tensor): Tensor of shape
                :math:`(C_{out}, C_{in} / \text{groups}, \text{kernel_size})`, then the size of kernel
                is :math:`(\text{kernel_size})`.
            bias (Tensor, optional): Bias Tensor with shape :math:`(C_{out})`.
                When bias is ``None`` , zeros will be used. Default: ``None`` .
            stride (Union[int, tuple[int], list[int]], optional): The movement stride of the 1D convolution kernel.
                The data type is an integer or a tuple of one integer. Default: ``1`` .
            padding (Union[int, tuple[int], list[int], str], optional): The number of padding
                on the input.
                The data type is an integer or a tuple of one integer or string {`valid`, `same`}.
                The value should be greater than or equal to 0. Default: ``0`` .

                - ``"same"``: Pad the input around its edges so that the shape of input and output
                  are the same when `stride` is set to ``1``.
                  The amount of padding to is calculated by the operator internally, If the amount is even, it is
                  uniformly distributed around the input, if it is odd, the excess amount goes to the right side.
                  If this mode is set, `stride` must be 1.

                - ``"valid"``: No padding is applied to the input, and the output returns the maximum
                  possible length. Extra sequence that could not complete a full stride will
                  be discarded.

            dilation (Union[int, tuple[int], list[int]], optional): Specifies the dilation rate to use for
                dilated convolution. It can be a single int or a tuple of 1 integer.
                Assuming :math:`dilation=(d)`, the convolutional kernel samples the input with a
                spacing of :math:`d-1` elements in the length direction.
                Default: ``1`` .
            groups (int, optional): Splits filter into groups, `in_channels` and `out_channels` must be
                divisible by `groups`. If the groups is equal to `in_channels` and `out_channels`,
                this 1D convolution layer also can be called 1D depthwise convolution layer. Default: ``1`` .
                The following restraints should be met:

                - :math:`(C_{in} \text{ % } \text{groups} == 0)`
                - :math:`(C_{out} \text{ % } \text{groups} == 0)`
                - :math:`(C_{out} >= \text{groups})`
                - :math:`(\text{weight[1]} = C_{in} / \text{groups})`

        Returns:
            Tensor, the value that applied 1D convolution. The shape is :math:`(N, C_{out}, L_{out})`.

        Raises:
            RuntimeError: On Ascend, due to the limitation of the L1 cache size of different NPU chip, if input size or
                kernel size is too large, it may trigger an error.

            TypeError: If `kernel_size`, `stride` or `dilation` is neither an int not a tuple.
            ValueError: Args and size of the input feature map should satisfy the output formula to ensure that the size of
                the output feature map is positive; otherwise, an error will be reported.
            ValueError: If `in_channels`, `out_channels`, `kernel_size`, `stride` or `dilation` is less than 1.

            ValueError: The `kernel_size` cannot exceed the size of the input feature map.
            ValueError: The value of `padding` cannot cause the calculation area to exceed the input size.
