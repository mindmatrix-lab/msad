    Adds scaled other value to input Tensor.
    
    .. math::
    
        out_{i} = input_{i} + alpha \times other_{i}
    
    Note:
        - When the two inputs have different shapes,
          they must be able to broadcast to a common shape.
        - The two inputs and alpha comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types
          consistent.
    
    Args:
        input (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]): The first input is a number.Number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is
            `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_ or
            `bool_ <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_.
        other (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]): The second input, is a number.Number or
            a bool or a tensor whose data type is
            `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_ or
            `bool_ <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_.
    
    Returns:
        Tensor with a shape that is the same as the broadcasted shape of the input `input` and `other`,
        and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among the two inputs and alpha.
    
    Raises:
        TypeError: If the type of `input`, `other`, or `alpha` is not one of the following: Tensor, number.Number, bool.
        TypeError: If `alpha` is of type float but `input` and `other` are not of type float.
        TypeError: If `alpha` is of type bool but `input` and `other` are not of type bool.
